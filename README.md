# Titanic-Dataset
# Exploratory Data Analysis.
This project to gain insights into the dataset and explore patterns.
# Overview
This dataset contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including survival status.
# Objective
The objective of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the characteristics of the Titanic dataset, find correlations between variables, and identify factors influencing survival rates.
# Tools and Libraries Used
Jupyter Notebook, Python
Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
# Analysis Steps
Data Loading, Data Cleaning, and data transformations.
# Exploratory Data Analysis
Visualize distributions, correlations, and patterns in the data.
# Feature Engineering
Creating new features or transforming existing ones to enhance model performance.
# Results
The analysis provides valuable insights into passenger demographics, survival rates, and factors affecting survival on the Titanic. Visualizations such as histograms, box plots, and correlation matrices are used to illustrate the findings.
